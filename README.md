Meta Reminders for Behavioral:
* We are looking to better understand your technical background, leadership, scope of responsibilities, and cross-functional collaboration experience. This is a great opportunity to discuss notable projects, successes, failures, lessons learned and things you're passionate about.
* Check out the sample questions listed in the Behavioral Interview section of the prep guide. 
* Be specific. Provide specific examples and avoid general statements. I recommend using a word doc and writing down a list of your “Big Wins” or “Notable projects” and practice succinctly verbalizing them. The STAR Method is useful for this.
* Be Honest. Don’t be afraid to self-critique if you learned something from the situation. Don’t be afraid to talk about what didn’t go well.


Resolving Confliction:

Tell me about yourself:

1. talk about why you want to be a role as you are today, 
2. if you have relevant skills, bring them up here 
3. and try to show evidence of progression convey that you're on an upward Journey 
4. Meta loves entrepreneurship and scrappiness. 
5. Meta Loves people from high end start-ups.
6. Always be humble. 
Why Meta? : show that Meta’s mission of connecting people resonates with you, include a personal story if possible.
1. yeah it's a great question So Meta as many people know as you know generally a very Innovative company at the Forefront of Technology doing a lot of really
interesting things with really great and smart people but this does apply to a lot of companies um in the Bay Area. Made the Llama model free for the public, that is really cool, 
2. I did some research, and talked with friend at Meta, they've had really great reviews of both the work culture the ability to have impact, the transparency at the company
and that the fact that they feel empowered to really lead and drive strategy for their team that's really appealing to me 
3. but really when it comes tools like Facebook uh and Instagram along with WhatsApp were really key and
important to helping me still feel connected with friends, find new friends when I move to Bay Area. 
At the end of day, so Facebook is a great company doing a lot of great Innovative things, doing we're working on the Forefront of innovation
and Technology, Friend working there enjoyed the job and the work they do, and referred me to the opening opportunity. And lastly, the mission that Meta to bring the world closer together.
 I feel I'm very interested and I feel that the type of technology and work that
Facebook does do and meta including things with the metaverse and again building more communities and helping people remotely and even
non-remotally be able to connect


Resolving conflict: What kind of disagreements have you had with colleagues and/or managers? 
How have you resolved them? Can you empathize with people whose points of view differ radically from yours?
Tell me about a time you solved a team conflict:
Situation, Problem? Solution, Impact, Lesson. 
one particular situation that comes to mind was when I was working with a team


Lessons learned from this conflict? 

Lack of understanding, understanding, gaps? Giving tech more information about the design having design work more closely with engineer , understand more about the structure, process
certain decisions should be made with  good justification, 

Tell me about time you failed at work:


Growing continuously: Your interviewer will be assessing your aptitude for seeking out opportunities for growth and learning. Do you take constructive criticism as an opportunity to improve? How have you approached improving your skills?


Embracing ambiguity: How do you operate in an ambiguous and quickly changing environment? Are you comfortable making decisions and maintaining high levels of productivity when you are missing information or lack clarity? How did you react when you had to quickly pivot away from a project due to a shift in priority?


Driving results: We will be evaluating your experience pushing yourself and others to deliver against goals and objectives. How do you demonstrate your impact? Are you self-directed in reaching goals despite challenges and roadblocks?



1. Give an example of a time you had to prioritize multiple tasks and meet deadlines. How did you manage your time effectivel

Prioritization, categorize each task as urgent and important(top and need immediate attention), important but not urgent, scheduled with some buffer time,
Urgent but not important, delegated if possible or tackled with a short timeframe. Not urgent, not important, postponed.
2. Task breakdown, breakdown each task into smaller actionable steps with specific due dates for each step, it made easier to track progress and ensure each task was on track
3. Using project management tool, JIRA ticket, to visually track progress, deadline, and dependencies, give updates, this allow team members to see where are are in the project and make informated decisions. 
4. Efficient communication, regular communication with the team and stakeholders is essential, provide updates on project Progress, addressed any challenges and proactively communicate any potential delays or risks
5. Time blocking, block some dedicated time slots for specific tasks to ensure that I could focus on them without interruptions.
6. Flexibility If a task required more time than anticipated, I made adjustments to the schedule and re-prioritized other tasks accordingly. 


Results:

By implementing these strategies, I successfully completed the project within the designated timeframe. The web application feature was launched on time and to a high standard, meeting all project requirements and earning positive feedback from stakeholders

meta behavioral questions: How have you approached improving yourself??

"In my previous role, I realized I needed to improve my presentation skills to effectively communicate complex technical information to a non-technical audience. To address this, I enrolled in a presentation skills course and actively practiced using the skills I learned in company meetings and project presentations. This led to a significant increase in my ability to engage the audience, keep them interested, and even facilitate more productive discussions. As a result, my presentations became more impactful and I was able to build stronger relationships with colleagues." 




there is a new requirement for your quick response but you don't know how to do it how do you deal with i




Solving a Team Conflict:
Situation: working with Maryam on model deployment and deployment
Conflict which one is better:
Action: 
Result:
Lessons:
* most conflicts stem from different priorities or communication gaps — not personal issues
1. Reframe Around Shared Goals: Shifting the conversation from “which solution is better” to “how do we deliver business impact” helped move the team from debate to collaboration. I’ve since used this tactic often to realign discussions.
* Iterative Thinking Resolves Tension: Proposing a phased approach — launching a simpler model first and continuing work on the complex one — showed me how incremental delivery can be a powerful compromise. It keeps progress moving while honoring long-term goals.
* Conflict Can Be Productive: respectful disagreement can spark innovation, as long as it's managed well. What mattered was creating psychological safety and focusing on outcomes. 
* A team win is the individual win.

How Do You Improve Yourself? (STAR)
S:
In my first year as a data scientist, I realized I was heavily focused on technical modeling, but I lacked strong product intuition — which limited my ability to frame problems from a user perspective.
Task: 
I wanted to become not just a model developer, but a product-minded data scientist who could influence strategy.
Action: I ask the PM to invite me to the product meetings and listen to what they are discussing, and some time ask simple stupid quetions, asking PMs to explain roadmap decisions, And I keep reading through lots of the company confluence page on the project overview and keep asking questions and understand the business behind it. I also began to prepare the presentation with my analysis not just in terms of metrics, but with hypotheses, user impact, and product trade-offs. I sought feedback regularly from PMs and engineers.
Result: Within a few months, I was invited to contribute to product strategy sessions. In one case, my user segmentation analysis led to a pivot in onboarding flow, improving activation by 8%. That experience showed me the value of continuous learning and cross-functional collaboration in leveling up.


Prioritizing Multiple Tasks & Time Management (STAR)

During a major product launch, I was responsible for finalizing model training, validation, and wrap the documentations for the experiments I have done, write clear methodology, data cleaning, feature engineer, model selection, and preparing a presentation for leadership — all due in two weeks.

Task:
I needed to deliver high-quality work across all tasks without burning out or missing deadlines.

Action:
I started by mapping out all deliverables and breaking them into sub-tasks with estimated time and dependencies. I used a priority matrix (urgent vs. important) to sequence the work, blocked focus time on my calendar, and communicated early with stakeholders about realistic timelines. I used the JIra board to keep track the progress of each main tasks and small tasks. Raising blockers and seeking support if possible. 
Result:
All tasks were completed on time. The launch went smoothly, the white paper is review by leadership team and get positive feedbacks, and the leadership deck sparked further investment in the product area. The experience reinforced how proactive planning, clear communication, and smart automation help manage high-pressure weeks effectively.
